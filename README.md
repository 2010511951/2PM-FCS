# 2PM-FCS
Sample fluoresence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) data and 2-pulse modulation in signal processing phase demo

10nM_GFP_trial1.asc (not provided here) contains the raw FCS data. The first column records the macro time while the second column records the micro time

macro time = first column / 5e7, unit: s (laser pulse frequency is 50 MHz)

10nM_GFP_trial1.mat contains the first column of raw FCS data extracted from the .asc file.
