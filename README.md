# 2PM-FCS
Sample fluoresence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) data and 2-pulse modulation in signal processing phase demo

Cy5.mat: the matlab compatible version of raw FCS data converted from https://github.com/FCSlib/FCSlib/blob/master/Sample%20Data/Cy5.tif

demo.m: the matlab demo script to compute and compare g2 and 2-pulse modulated K_{2P}^2 from raw FCS data

run demo.m in MATLAB to start
